# Grocery-List-Project
# When you hit run, a menu of options will appear.
# Type in a number 1-8 that corresponds with the option you would like to choose.
# Depending on the option, it may ask you a followup question for what item you would like to select or a new item you would like to add to the list.
# Worked on with Sierra Philban for the first part of this project.
